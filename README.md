# Spotify-Like-Predictor
First machine learning project built on sklearn.naive_bayes to estimate whether I would like the song or not.

### Introduction ###     
This is a simple python application which is trying to learn my preferances towards music and then estimate whether I would like the particular song or not. The data set is generated from two csv files:
* Features are fed from songs_i_like.csv
* Labels are fed from labels.csv
